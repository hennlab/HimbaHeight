# HimbaHeight
The code and QCed dataset with de-identified IDs (matching the dbGaP IDs) 

The dataset included has been modified so that the ID values are de-identified. These ID values match the IDs for corresponding individuals in the dbGaP dataset (genetic data).
The R script shows how the final dataset (provided here) was put together by combining the genetic, height, and fosterage data. Additionally, it shows QC filtering steps.
